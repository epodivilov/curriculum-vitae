          <h4>Game developer at <a href="https://hgstudio.ru/" target="_blank">Happy Games Studio</a></h4>
          <p>Worked on developing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERv9ne35sNA" target="_blank">"Ranch
              Adventures"</a> game
            based on PixiJS, combining match-3 and farm elements. In the project, I was responsible for the animations
            of destruction and appearance of game elements. I was also fully in charge of developing the farming part of
            the game: farm rendering, creating a system that allowed players to manage farm decorations. In addition, I
            developed the farm interface, including the display of lives,
            currency, level, and other elements.</p>

          <p>Developed a system for modal windows, input forms, and friend lists with scrolling. Apart from the game, I
            completely rewrote the existing level administration system from a single-page JQuery script to modular

            ability to view statistics on levels, control the order of levels, and other features for the convenience of
            the game designer.</p>
